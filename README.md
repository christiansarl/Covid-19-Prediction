**COVID-19 Mortality Prediction Project**

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive modeling project focused on predicting COVID-19 mortality using machine learning techniques. The study explores the performance of three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Two distinct sets of features are employed: the first set derived from previous research, and a new set obtained through Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

**Datasets**

Contains information from 375 patients
Includes 40 relevant features

**Results**

The study demonstrates that the Random Forest model outperforms other models in predicting COVID-19 mortality. Confidence intervals analysis reveals a performance increase with the new feature set, though the difference is not deemed statistically significant.

**Repository Contents**

Code: Python scripts and Jupyter Lab for implementing models and conducting analyses..
Results: Outputs, visualizations, and performance metrics obtained from the models.
Documentation: Additional resources, such as the paper summarizing the findings.
